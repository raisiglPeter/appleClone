This is my first attempt at making a basic HTML/CSS/JS website.
It is a clone of the iPhone portion of the apple.ca website created for a front-end class. URL - https://www.apple.com/ca/iphone/

Navigation:
- The Apple logo is a link to the landing page - index.html
- The products bar has three working links: iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 and iPhone SE which link to the shop pages
- The Buy buttons on the landing page each go to their respective product pages
- On the shop pages, the Apple logo, Store and iPhone links in the navbar link back to index.html
